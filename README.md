# odin-library
Library Project in the JavaScript course for The Odin Project.

I went a bit too far on the layout of this particular project, and while I feel happy with the end design,
I certainly learned more about what not to do than what to do.

This project in particular highlighted the importance of mobile-first layout design; it's generally much easier to make something expand
to fit larger sizes than it is to make it contract to fit a smaller size. 
Even with an attempt at a media query, there was no easy way to make the layout work on mobile after so much time put into it. 

I also learned that I should begin with function above form. Getting lost in the gloss and visuals I wanted to implement
meant the process of building the basic functions was complicated and obscured, leading to a lot of confusion when the time came
to make it work.
